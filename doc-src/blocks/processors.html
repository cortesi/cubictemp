<h1> Using processors </h1>

<p> There is a powerful extension to the named block syntax that deserves a
section of its own. </p>


<h1> A pertinent example </h1>

<p> Block processors are incredibly useful. This document, for instance, is
written and maintained with a document rendering system that uses CubicTemp
templates. Have a look at the Python code examples in this manual. Writing and
maintaining syntax highlighted Python code by hand would be well neigh
impossible (view the source for this page to see what's involved). Instead, we
have written a Python wrapper object, that takes a block normal Python code as
input, and produces properly indented and highlighted HTML when the "__repr__"
method is called.  Named blocks now make it easy to integrate the snippets of
example code, and the rules for presenting them. Here is the the section of the
template that produced the code sample above: </p>

<p> The code above simply places the class "ColourPython" (too long to show
here in full) in the namespace that gets passed to the template instance. The
class is now available for instantiation within our template. The template then
simply passes the output of a named block to the class, and the resulting
string is displayed. Note the presence of the "_cubictemp_unescaped" attribute
in the ColourPython class. This makes sure that our object can use special HTML
characters in its expansion, without interference from the escaping
mechanism.</p>
