<p> Cubictemp provides the programmer with the ability to define named blocks -
that is, blocks of text that are defined in the template body itself, and can
be referenced by name anywhere after the definition. </p>

<!--(block|cubescript)-->
    <!--(_block bar)-->
        The time has come the @_!foo!@ said
        To speak of many things...
    <!--(_end)-->
    @_!bar!@
<!--(end)-->

<p> The template definition above declares a named block called "bar", which can
then be referenced by name in the template. Behind the scenes, the lines in the
block definition are actually used to instantiate a nested CubicTemp template,
with a namespace equal to that where the block was <i>declared</i>. This
template definition is then inserted into the current namespace, under the name
specified in the block definition. Using the following piece of code:</p>

<!--(block|pysyntax)-->
import cubictemp

temp = cubictemp.File("template", foo="walrus")
print temp
<!--(end)-->

<p>the template above will output:</p>

<pre>
    The time has come the walrus said
    To speak of many things...
</pre>

<p> Notice that the contents of the named block are not inserted into the
output due to the <i>definition</i> of the named block, but rather due to its
occurence in the following substitution tag.</p>

<p> One more thing that should be mentioned is the fact that named blocks (and
Cubictemp templates in general) have the "_cubictemp_unescaped" attribute
defined by default. This means that they will go unescaped when inserted using
the standard 

<!--(block|cubescript)-->
<code class="template">@_!...!@</code> 
<!--(end)-->

escaped subsitution syntax. This arrangement makes sense when you consider that
the raw content of named blocks will almost never originate from an untrusted
source, and that blocks very commonly intentionally contain HTML. </p>


<h2> Calling blocks </h2>

<p> During our discussion of <a href="../templates.html">templates</a>, we
noted that a Template object can be rendered by calling it like a function. The
user can also pass a set of keyword arguments to this call, which over-rides
the namespace provided at the instantiation of the object. The same is true for
named blocks - you can call a block, and provide namespace arguments
on-the-fly. Consider the following template:</p>

<!--(block|cubescript)-->
    <!--(_block bar)-->
        The time has come the @_!foo!@ said
        To speak of many things...
    <!--(_end)-->
    @_!bar(foo="walrus")!@
    @_!bar(foo="carpenter"")!@
<!--(end)-->

<p> Regardless of the arguments supplied during instantiation of the Template
object, the template above will produce the following output: </p>

<pre>
	The time has come the walrus said
	To speak of many things...

	The time has come the carpenter said
	To speak of many things...
</pre>


<h2> A pertinent example </h2>

<p> Named blocks are incredibly useful. This document, for instance, is written
and maintained with a system that uses CubicTemp templates extensively. Have a
look at the Python code examples in this manual. Writing and maintaining syntax
highlighted Python code by hand would be well neigh impossible (view the source
for this page to see what's involved). Instead, we have written a Python
wrapper object, that takes a block normal Python code as input, and produces
properly indented and highlighted HTML when the "__repr__" method is called.
Named blocks now make it easy to integrate the snippets of example code, and
the rules for presenting them. Here is the the section of the template that
produced the code sample above: </p>

<p> The code above simply places the class "ColourPython" (too long to show
here in full) in the namespace that gets passed to the template instance. The
class is now available for instantiation within our template. The template then
simply passes the output of a named block to the class, and the resulting
string is displayed. Note the presence of the "_cubictemp_unescaped" attribute
in the ColourPython class. This makes sure that our object can use special HTML
characters in its expansion, without interference from the escaping
mechanism.</p>
