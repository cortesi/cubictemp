<h1> Repeat Blocks </h1>

<p>One of the most common templating tasks is the need to produce output from a
sequence of items. For instance, we may need to fill a table with values, or
dynamically generate a list-box. Cubictemp provides a repeat construct to take
care of this problem. </p>

<!--(block|cubescript|htmlSyntax)-->
<!--(_for foo in bar)-->
    @_!foo!@
<!--(_end)-->
<!--(end)-->

<p> The template above does exactly what anyone familiar with Python would
expect - it loops through all elements of "bar" (which has to be a sequence or
an iterable), setting the value of "foo" to each element in turn. As in simple
substitutions, the sequence definition is evaluated as an expression. This
allows us to do things like the following:</p>

<!--(block|cubescript|htmlSyntax)-->
<!--(_for foo in range(3))-->
    Counting: @_!foo!@
<!--(_end)-->
<!--(end)-->

<p>... producing the output:</p>

<pre>
Counting: 0
Counting: 1
Counting: 2
</pre>
