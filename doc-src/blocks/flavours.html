Before we go on to discuss the use and properties of the other two types of
block, take a moment to look at the block definitions above. Notice that the
start and end directives of the block are crafted to look like HTML comments.
This means that when you view your template in a browser, these directives are
invisible, but the contents are viewable. This is handy in some circumstances,
but it might not always be what we want. In fact, CubicTemp block directives
have three different "flavours". The first, in which the directives are
comments, but content is visible, you have already met:<br>
<br>

<!--(block foo)-->
	<!--(raw)-->
<!--(raw)-->
	@!bar!@
<!--(end)-->
	<!--(end)-->
<!--(end)-->
<code class="template">
	@!escape(repr(foo))!@<br>
</code>
<br>

Sometimes, however, we would prefer to have the entire block appear as a
comment. The second block "flavour" allows us to write blocks that are HTML
comments in their entirety.<br>
<br>

<!--(block foo)-->
	<!--(raw)-->
<!--(raw)
	@!bar!@
(end)-->
	<!--(end)-->
<!--(end)-->
<code class="template">
	@!escape(repr(foo))!@<br>
</code>
<br>

In the third flavour, the entire block is uncommented. It also serves as a
nice shorthand, and is the preferred way of writing non-HTML templates. <br>
<br>

<!--(block foo)-->
	<!--(raw)-->
<(raw)
	@!bar!@
(end)>
	<!--(end)-->
<!--(end)-->
<code class="template">
	@!escape(repr(foo))!@<br>
</code>
<br>

There is <b>no</b> functional difference whatsoever between these three. They
are completely interchangeable - in fact, you can even use one type of start
definition and a different type of end definition in the same block (although
it is hard to imagine a reason to do this). The usefulness of the block
definition types will become clear in the discussion of repeat blocks and named
blocks.<p>

It should be noted that while the above seems very HTML-specific, CubicTemp is
still very much a general templating system. The syntax of both straight
substitutions and block definitions can be changed quite easily by altering a
couple of regular expressions in the template class.<br>
