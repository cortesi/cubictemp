<h1> Playing nice with your designers: closed and open tags</h1>

<p> Before we go on to discuss the use and properties of the different block
types, lets take a moment to have another look at the block syntax. </p>


<!--(block|cubescript|htmlSyntax)-->
<!--(_block foo)-->
    @_!bar!@
<!--(_end)-->
<!--(end)-->


<p> Notice that the start and end directives of the block are crafted to look
like HTML comments.  This means that when you view your unrendered template in
a browser, these directives are invisible, but their contents are viewable.
This is handy in some circumstances, but it might not always be what we want.
In fact, Cubictemp block directives have two different "flavours". The
<b>closed</b> tag flavour, shown above, allows us to specify directives that
are full HTML comments. The <b>open</b> tag flavour allows us to write blocks
that are HTML comments in their entirety:</p>

<!--(block|cubescript|htmlSyntax)-->
<!--(_block foo)
    @_!bar!@
(_end)-->
<!--(end)-->

<p> There is no functional difference between the two flavours. The two
flavours simply allow us to craft templates that can easily be viewed in a
web-browser, without being rendered first.</p>
