Speed and object instantiation
==============================

Cubictemp does as much work as it can at template instantiation. The template
is parsed, blocks are readied for execution, and all expressions are
pre-compiled. This means that Cubictemp is very, very fast when used in
long-running applications like FastCGI applications, where templates can be
initialised once up-front and then re-used. A nice by-product of this mode of
operation is that syntax errors are caught during the pre-compilation process,
as soon as templates are instantiated.
