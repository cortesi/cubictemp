__A small, elegant templating system for Python.__

Features
========

    * Simple, easy to use, well-tested and well-documented.

    * Integrates tightly with Python - pass arbitrary Python objects into a
    template, walk sequences and iterators, evaluate expressions.

    * Includes default escaping, protecting you against common classes of
    HTML and Javascript Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

    * Encourages separation of interface and program logic by disallowing
    statements in templates.

    * Cubictemp is tiny (only ~ 170 SLOC). There are many large, over-designed
    Python templating systems out there.  Cubictemp proves that a templating
    sytem can be complete, elegant, powerful, fast and small, all at the same
    time.

Cubictemp requires Python 2.4 or newer.


Hello walrus
============

The following example constructs a template with a single substitution tag, and
then calls it with an evaluation namespace:

<!--(block | cubescript | pySyntax)-->
import cubictemp

template = cubictemp.Template("Hello @_!foo!@.")
print template(foo="walrus")
<!--(end)-->

The output of this program is:

<pre class="output">
Hello walrus.
</pre>
