<h1> Features </h1>

<p><b> Cubictemp is a small, elegant templating system for Python.</b></p>

<ul>

    <li> Encourages separation of interface and program logic by disallowing
    statements in templates. </li>

    <li> Integrates tightly with Python, allowing you to pass arbitrary Python
    objects into a template, walk sequences and iterators, and evaluate
    expressions.</li>

    <li> Includes default escaping, protecting you against common classes of
    HTML and Javascript Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.</li>

    <li> Cubictemp is tiny - only ~ 170 SLOC. This is a good thing. There are
    many large, over-designed Python templating systems out there.  Cubictemp
    proves that a templating sytem can be complete, elegant, powerful, fast and
    small, all at the same time.</li>

    <li> Simple, easy to use, well-tested and well-documented. </li>

</ul>


<h1> Requirements </h1>

<p> Cubictemp requires Python 2.4 or newer. </p>
