<p> Cubictemp is a small, elegant templating system for Python. It was
developed by Nullcube, and has formed a successful and unobtrusive part of many
commercial and even a few Open Source projects. We hope you find it as useful
as we have. </p>


<h2> Features </h2>

<ul>

    <li> Cubictemp provides enough power to make the common-case usage as
    effortless as possible, while at the same time encouraging good design by
    dis-allowing statements in templates. </li>

    <li> Cubictemp integrates tightly with Python, allowing you to pass
    arbitrary Python objects into a template, walk sequences and iterators, and
    evaluate expressions.</li>

	<li> Cubictemp includes default protection against common classes of HTML
	and Javascript Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.</li>

	<li> Cubictemp is tiny. This is a good thing. There are many large,
	over-designed Python templating systems out there. Cubictemp demonstrates
	that a templating sytem can be complete, elegant, powerful and small, all
	at the same time.</li>

    <li> Cubictemp is simple, easy to use, well-tested and well-documented. </li>

</ul>


<h2> Requirements </h2>

<p> Cubictemp requires Python 2.2 or better. </p>
