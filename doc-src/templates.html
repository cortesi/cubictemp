<h2>The Temp Class</h2>

<p> The Temp class is instantiated as follows: </p>

<!--(block|pySyntax)-->
Temp(template, **kwargs)
<!--(end)-->

<p> ... where "template" is the complete text of a template and kwargs is a set
of name/value pairs that make up the initial namespace of the template. Temp
objects are rendered when they are called - 


<p> The Temp object is rendered whenever its __repr__() method is called -
i.e. whenever the template needs to be converted to a string. In the example
above, this happens invisibly in the line <code>print temp</code>, but it can
be done more explicitly through <code>repr(temp)</code> or just plain
<code>`temp`</code>, which will both return the rendered string. The template
is re-rendered every time this happens.<p>


<p> A Temp object can also be rendered by calling it like a function: </p>

<!--(block | pySyntax )-->
temp = Temp(template, one=1, two=2)
print temp(one=3, two=4)
<!--(end)-->

<p> The keyword arguments passed to the call "over-ride" the keyword arguments
passed during the object's instantiation.</p>


<h2>The File Class</h2>

<p> Cubictemp also contains a small helper class named "File". It wraps the
Temp class to ease a common usage scenario: loading a template from a file. The
File class is instantiated as follows:</p>

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
File(path, **kwargs)
<!--(end)-->

<p> The "path" argument is the full path to a Cubictemp template. The File
class also makes reading exceptions a bit more convenient by pre-pending the
template file path to error messages. </p>
