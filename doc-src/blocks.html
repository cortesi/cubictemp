<p> Much of the power and utility of Cubictemp templates lie in the use of
block constructs. A block is exactly what it sounds like - a chunk of text,
that may contain newlines, and that is acted on in some way by the template.
Cubictemp understands two block types:</p>

<ul>

    <li> @!aLink("named.html", "Named blocks")!@ provide a way of "naming" a
    piece of text, and then performing some manipulation on it.</li>

    <li> @!aLink("repeat.html", "Repeat blocks")!@ allow the insertion of
    sequences of data. </li>

</ul>
