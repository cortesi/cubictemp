Defining blocks
===============

<p> Cubictemp allows you to define named blocks - chunks of text that are
defined in the template body, and can be referenced by name. </p>

<!--(block|cubescript|htmlSyntax)-->
<!--(_block bar)-->
    The time has come the @_!foo!@ said
    To speak of many things...
<!--(_end)-->
one
@_!bar!@
two
@_!bar!@
three
<!--(end)-->

<p> The template definition above declares a named block called "bar", and then
substitutes it into the page - you may think of it as similar to declaring and
then calling a Python function. Using the following piece of code:</p>

<!--(block|pySyntax)-->
print cubictemp.File(template, foo="walrus")
<!--(end)-->

<p>the template above will output:</p>

<pre>
    one
    The time has come the walrus said
    To speak of many things...
    two
    The time has come the walrus said
    To speak of many things...
    three
</pre>

<p> Notice that the contents of the named block are not inserted into the
output due to the <i>definition</i> of the named block, but rather due to its
occurence in the following substitution tag. Blocks can be nested to arbitrary
depths. Block namespaces and scopes work similarly to Python namespaces and
scopes. Consider the following template:</p>

<!--(block|cubescript|htmlSyntax)-->
<!--(_block bar)-->
    <!--(_block bar)-->
    one
    <!--(_end)-->
    @_!bar!@
    two
<!--(_end)-->
@_!bar!@
<!--(_block bar)-->
    three
<!--(_end)-->
@_!bar!@
<!--(end)-->

<p> When evaluated, this will print: </p>



<pre>
    one
    two
    three
</pre>


<p> Named blocks, like <b>Template</b> and <b>File</b> objects, have the
"_cubictemp_unescaped" attribute defined by default. This means that they will
go unescaped when inserted using the standard 

<!--(block|cubescript)-->
<code class="template">@_!...!@</code> 
<!--(end)-->

escaped subsitution syntax. This arrangement makes sense when you consider that
the raw content of named blocks will almost never originate from an untrusted
source, and that blocks very commonly intentionally contain HTML. </p>


<h1> Calling blocks </h1>

<p> During the discussion templates, we noted
that a Template object can be rendered by calling it like a function. The user
can also pass a set of keyword arguments to this call, which over-rides the
namespace provided at the instantiation of the object. The same is true for
named blocks - you can call a block, and provide namespace arguments
on-the-fly. Consider the following template:</p>

<!--(block|cubescript|htmlSyntax)-->
<!--(_block bar)-->
    The time has come the @_!foo!@ said
    To speak of many things...
<!--(_end)-->
@_!bar(foo="walrus")!@

@_!bar(foo="carpenter")!@
<!--(end)-->

<p> Regardless of the arguments supplied during instantiation of the Template
object, the template above will produce the following output: </p>

<pre>
The time has come the walrus said
To speak of many things...

The time has come the carpenter said
To speak of many things...
</pre>


<h1> Playing nice with your designers: closed and open tags</h1>

<p> Before we go on to discuss the use and properties of the different block
types, lets take a moment to have another look at the block syntax. </p>


<!--(block|cubescript|htmlSyntax)-->
<!--(_block foo)-->
    @_!bar!@
<!--(_end)-->
<!--(end)-->


<p> Notice that the start and end directives of the block are crafted to look
like HTML comments.  This means that when you view your unrendered template in
a browser, these directives are invisible, but their contents are viewable.
This is handy in some circumstances, but it might not always be what we want.
In fact, Cubictemp block directives have two different "flavours". The
<b>closed</b> tag flavour, shown above, allows us to specify directives that
are full HTML comments. The <b>open</b> tag flavour allows us to write blocks
that are HTML comments in their entirety:</p>

<!--(block|cubescript|htmlSyntax)-->
<!--(_block foo)
    @_!bar!@
(_end)-->
<!--(end)-->

<p> There is no functional difference between the two flavours. The two
flavours simply allow us to craft templates that can easily be viewed in a
web-browser, without being rendered first.</p>
