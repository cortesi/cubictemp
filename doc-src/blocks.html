<p> Much of the power and utility of Cubictemp templates lie in the use of
block constructs.  A block is exactly what it sounds like - a chunk of text,
that may contain newlines, and that is acted on in some way by the template.
There are 3 types of block in Cubictemp:</p>

<ul>

    <li> <a href="blocks/raw.html">Raw blocks</a> blocks mark sections
    of text that Cubictemp should not process.</li>

    <li> <a href="blocks/named.html">Named blocks</a> provide a way of
    "naming" a piece of text, and then performing some manipulation on it.
    </li>

    <li> <a href="blocks/repeat.html">Repeat blocks</a> allow the
    insertion of sequences of data. </li>

</ul>

<p> Each of these will be discussed in turn in the following sections.</p>


<h2> Block Syntax </h2>


<p> Cubictemp blocks all have the same basic syntax: </p> 

<!--(block|cubescript)-->
    <!--(<_block definition>)-->
        text
    <!--(_end)-->
<!--(end)-->

<p> ... where ("<block definition>") varies between block types. Blocks can be
nested as deeply as you wish. </p>

<h2> Closed and half-open Block Tags</h2>

<p> Before we go on to discuss the use and properties of the different block
types, take a moment to look at the block syntax above. Notice that the start
and end directives of the block are crafted to look like HTML comments.  This
means that when you view your unrendered template in a browser, these
directives are invisible, but the contents are viewable. This is handy in some
circumstances, but it might not always be what we want. In fact, CubicTemp
block directives have two different "flavours". The first, in which the
directives are comments, but content is visible, you have already met: </p>

<!--(block|cubescript)-->
    <!--(_block foo)-->
        @_!bar!@
    <!--(_end)-->
<!--(end)-->

<p> Sometimes, however, we would prefer to have the entire block appear as a
comment. The second block "flavour" allows us to write blocks that are HTML
comments in their entirety.</p>

<!--(block|cubescript)-->
    <!--(_block foo)
        @_!bar!@
    (_end)-->
<!--(end)-->

<p> There is <b>no</b> functional difference whatsoever between the two
flavours. The two flavours simply allow us to craft templates that can easily
be viewed in a web-browser, without being rendered first.  We will work through
examples of this in the discussion of repeat blocks and named blocks.</p>
