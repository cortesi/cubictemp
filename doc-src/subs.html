Tags and Expressions
====================

Cubictemp evaluates expressions between tag delimiters as expressions in the
specified namespace. The result is converted to a string, and placed in the
rendered template. There are two flavours of delimiters: __escaped__ 
<!--(block|cubescript)-->
- @_!...!@ -
<!--(end)-->
and __unescaped__
<!--(block|cubescript)-->
- $_!...!$.
<!--(end)-->

Example
-------

<pre class="output">
<!--(block|cubescript)-->
@_!foo!@ times two is @_!foo*2!@
@_!foo!@ squared is @_!foo*foo!@
@_!"yes" if (1==2) else "no"!@
key is $_!mydict["key"]!$
<!--(end)-->
</pre>

...with the following code:

<!--(block|pySyntax)-->
import cubictemp
print cubictemp.File(
            "template",
            foo=3,
            mydict=dict(key="value")
        )
<!--(end)-->

... produces this:

<pre class="output">
3 times two is 6
3 squared is 9
no
key is value
</pre>

At this point it is important to distinguish between Python expressions and
statements. An <b>expressions</b> can be thought of as anything that can be on
the right-hand-side of an equals sign. Arithmetic operators, boolean operators,
parentheses for grouping, method/function calls, object instantiation and
conditional expressions are all valid components of expressions. Python
<b>statements</b> include things like <b>while</b>, <b>print</b>, variable
assignment and full <b>if</b> blocks. Cubictemp allows <b>only expressions</b>
in subtitution tags. 


Escaping
========

In an escaped substitution tag, the following characters are converted to their
corresponding HTML escape sequences: &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, &#146;.
Concretely, this means that the following program:

<!--(block|cubescript|pySyntax)-->
import cubictemp
print cubictemp.Template(
        "@_!x!@ $_!x!$",
        x = "<H1>foo</H1>"
    )
<!--(end)-->

... will print:

<!--(block|htmlSyntax)-->
<H1>foo</H1> &lt;H1&gt;foo&lt;/H1&gt;
<!--(end)-->

Always use the <b>escaped</b> substitution syntax if you can. When you really
need to place HTML in a substitution tag, make sure you carefully evaluate the
application context to make sure that users cannot inject malicious data.


Controlling Escaping
====================

Sometimes, it is handy to be able to construct objects that bypass Cubictemp's
escaping mechanism, regardless of the type of tag in which they occur. You can
signal this to cubictemp by giving the object a special attribute
"_cubictemp_unescaped" which evaluates to true.
